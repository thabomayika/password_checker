this is what you need to know on how to run these tests:

1. install python and pytest first running these tests

2. when done installing go to the terminal and type in 'pytest test_password_is_valid.py" and run it

3. when you are done with the first test and run the next test "pytest test_password_is_ok.py and run it in your terminal
