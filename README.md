# Password Checker
## This project was about creating a password checker that will go through a password and determine whether the password is valid or not, this really helped me understand what powers I had with python on my side.

### this is what you need to know on how to run these tests: 

1. install python and pytest first running these tests

2. when done installing go to the terminal and type in `pytest test_password_is_valid.py` and run it

3. when you are done with the first test and run the next test `pytest test_password_is_ok.py` and run it in your terminal
